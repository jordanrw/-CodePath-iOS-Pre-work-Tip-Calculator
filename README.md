# -CodePath-iOS-Pre-work-Tip-Calculator
the pre course work for the CodePath iOS course in swift

This app allows the user to enter the cost of the bill, select the percentage for the tip.  Then it gives the user the tip amount and the total cost of the meal.

There is a switch which allows the user to switch between a dark and light UI.

I also implemented another class which gives the app an advanced textfield.  It automatically places the '$' ',' '.' and formats everything for currency.
